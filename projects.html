            <h3>Hotel Room Booking System</h3>
            <p>Undertook this project as part of my OOP classwork in 2018. 
            Collaborated with a team of three classmates to design a program that books guests into a hotel depending on the floor they prefer.</p>
            <p>Some of the skills gained in the process include: An appreciation for teamwork, the use of Git for version control, 
            a good understanding of the Software Development Lifecycle, and the need to write well-designed and documented code</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Jiji House</h3>
            <p>Completed this project while a mentee at KamiLimu as part of its Innovation curriculum.
            Collaborated with a team of two to identify a pressing socio-economic challenge facing the society, ideate a solution for it, and pitch it to a team of potential investors.</p>
            <p>As many tenants face difficulties while looking for rental houses in Nairobi, the solution identified - Jiji House - was a web-based platform that used 3D cameras and geo-tags
            to enable easy visiting and viewing of available housing units.</p>
            <p>Some of the skills gained in the process was how to identify real-world problems worth solving, the use of design thinking in coming up with solutions, creating an effective pitch deck, and pitching to investors</p>
